# Voxel-Based-Minecraft-3D-Printer
Converts stl files to a voxel representation and prints it in Minecraft

Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios that allows players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world. These blocks can be interpreted sort of like voxels as, voxels are representations of values on a grid in three-dimensional space.

The idea is that I wanted to treat minecraft as the "print bed" for 3D objects stored in stl (Standard Triangle Language) files to create those 3d objects in the world of minecraft.

I did this by creating a tkinter UI that allows one to upload the file, choose the files start coordinates, and preview the build.
